                        <b>limitations of Python</b><br>
                        <ul><br>
                            <li><b>Parallel Processing:</b> While Python supports parallel execution, it is not as efficient as some other languages like JavaScript or Go.</li><br>
                            <li><b>Performance:</b> As an interpreted language, Python runs slower compared to C or C++, making it less ideal for high-performance applications like 3D graphics-intensive games.</li><br>
                            <li><b>Evolving Documentation:</b> Python continues to evolve, but comprehensive documentation remains limited compared to more established languages.</li><br>
                            <li><b>User Base:</b> Python has fewer users compared to widely adopted languages like C, C++, or Java, although its popularity is growing.</li><br>
                            <li><b>Multiprocessor Support:</b> Python lacks full-fledged multiprocessor support, which can impact performance in highly parallel applications.</li><br>
                            <li><b>Commercial Adoption:</b> Compared to mainstream languages, Python has limited commercial backing and enterprise-level support.</li><br>
                            <li><b>Computational Speed:</b> Python is slower for heavy computational tasks and desktop applications when compared to C or C++.</li><br>
                            <li><b>Deployment Challenges:</b> Packaging large Python applications into a single executable file can be complex, making distribution to non-technical users more difficult.<b></b></li><br>
